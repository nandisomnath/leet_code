## 🔧 How to Run the Project Files

All solutions are written in **Java**. To run a particular solution:

1. **Clone this repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nandisomnath/leet_code.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the solution file** you are interested in (typically each file/class corresponds to a problem).

3. **Compile and run using the command-line (assuming JDK is installed):**  
   ```sh
